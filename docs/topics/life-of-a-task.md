# Life of a Task

When a message is sent to an agent, it can choose to reply with either:

- A stateless `Message`.
- A stateful `Task` followed by zero or more `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` or `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`.

If the response is a `Message`, the interaction is completed. On the other hand, A `Task` will keep getting updated until it is in an interrupted state (`input-required`, `auth-required`, or `user-consent-required`) or a terminal state (`completed`, `cancelled`, `rejected`, or `failed`). The `user-consent-required` state pauses the task until the end-user provides explicit consent for sensitive operations, such as booking travel or sharing personal data.

## Context

A `contextId` logically composes many `Task` objects and independent `Message` objects. If the A2A agent uses an LLM internally, it can utilize the `contextId` to manage the LLM context.

For the first time a message is sent, agent replies back with a `contextId`. If the agent responded with a task, then it will also have a `taskId`. Clients can send subsequent messages and attach the same `contextId` to indicate to the agent, that they are continuing their previous interaction within the same context. Client can optionally attach the `taskId` to a subsequent message to indicate that the message is in continuation of that specific task.

`contextId` allows collaboration over a goal or share a single contextual session across multiple tasks.

## Agent: Message or a Task

Messages can be used for trivial interactions which do not require long-running processing or collaboration. An agent can use messages to negotiate the acceptance of a task. Once an agent maps the intent of an incoming message to a supported capability, it can reply back with a `Task`.

So conceptually there can be three levels of agents:

1. An agent which always responds with `Message` objects only. Doesn't do complex state management, no long running execution and uses contextID to tie messages together. Agent most probably directly wraps around an LLM invocation and simple tools.
2. Generates a `Task`, does more substantial work that can be tracked and runs over extended life time.
3. Generates both `Message` and `Task` objects. Uses messages to negotiate agent capability and scope of work for a task. Then sends `Task` object to track its execution and collaborate over task states like more input-needed, error handling, etc.

An agent can choose to always reply back with `Task` objects and model simple responses as tasks in `completed` state.

## Task Refinements & Follow-ups

Clients may want to follow up with new asks based on the results of a task, and/or refine upon the task results. This can be modeled by starting another interaction using the same `contextId` as the original task. Clients can further hint the agent by providing the reference to the original task using `referenceTaskIds` in `Message` object. Agent would then respond with either a new `Task` or a `Message`.

Once a task has reached a terminal state (`completed`, `cancelled`, `rejected` or `failed`), it can't be restarted. There are some benefits to this:

- **Task Immutability**: Clients can reliably reference tasks and their associated state, artifacts, and messages.
    - This provides a clean mapping of inputs to outputs.
    - Useful for mapping client orchestrator to task execution.
- **Clear Unit of Work**: Every new request, refinement, or a follow-up becomes a distinct task, simplifying bookkeeping and allowing for granular tracking of an agent's work.
    - Each artifact can be traced to a unit task.
    - This unit of work can be referenced much more granularly by parent agents or other systems like agent optimizers. In case of restartable tasks, all the subsequent refinements are combined, and any reference to an interaction would need to resort to some kind of message index range.
- **Easier Implementation**: No ambiguity for agent developers, whether to create a new task or restart an existing task. Once a task is in terminal state, any related subsequent interaction would need to be within a new task.

### Parallel Follow-ups

Parallel work is supported by having agents create distinct, parallel tasks for each follow-up message sent within the same contextId. This allows clients to track individual tasks and create new dependent tasks as soon as a prerequisite task is complete.

For example:

```none
Task 1: Book a flight to Helsinki.
(After Task 1 finishes)
Task 2: Based on Task 1, book a hotel.
Task 3: Based on Task 1, book a snowmobile activity.
(After Task 2 finishes, while Task 3 is still in progress)
Task 4: Based on Task 2, add a spa reservation to the hotel booking.
```

### Referencing Previous Artifacts

The serving agent is responsible for inferring the relevant artifact from the referenced task or from the `contextId`. The serving agent, as the domain expert, is best suited to resolve ambiguity or identify missing information because they are the ones who generated the artifacts.

If there is ambiguity (e.g., multiple artifacts could fit the request), the agent will ask the client for clarification by returning an input-required state. The client can then specify the artifact in its response. Client can optionally populate artifact reference {artifactId, taskId} in part metadata. This allows for linkage between inputs for follow-up tasks and previously generated artifacts.

This approach allows for the client implementation to be simple.

### Tracking Artifact Mutation

A follow up or refinement can result in an older artifact being modified and newer artifacts being generated. It would be good to know this linkage and maybe track all mutations of the artifact to make sure only the latest copy is used for future context. Something like a linked list, with the head as the latest version of the task result.

But the client is best suited, as well as is the real judge of what it considers as an acceptable result. And in fact can reject the mutation as well. Hence, the serving agent should not own this linkage and hence this linkage does not need to be part of A2A protocol spec. Clients can maintain the linkage on their end and show the latest version to the user.

To help with the tracking, the serving agent should maintain the same artifact-name when generating a refinement on the original artifact.

For follow-up or refinement tasks, the client is best suited to refer to the "latest" or what it considers to be the intended artifact to be refined upon. If the artifact reference is not explicitly specified, the serving agent can:

- Use context to figure out the latest artifact.
- Or in case of ambiguity or context not supported, agent can use `input-required` task state.

### Example Follow-up

#### Client sends message to agent for image generation

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-001",
  "method": "message/send",
  "params": {
    "message": {
      "role": "user",
      "parts": [
        {
          "kind": "text",
          "text": "Generate an image of a sailboat on the ocean."
        }
      ],
      "messageId": "msg-user-001"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Agent responds with boat image

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-001",
  "result": {
    "id": "task-boat-gen-123",
    "contextId": "ctx-conversation-abc",
    "status": {
      "state": "completed",
    },
    "artifacts": [
      {
        "artifactId": "artifact-boat-v1-xyz",
        "name": "sailboat_image.png",
        "description": "A generated image of a sailboat on the ocean.",
        "parts": [
          {
            "kind": "file",
            "file": {
              "name": "sailboat_image.png",
              "mimeType": "image/png",
              "bytes": "<base64_encoded_png_data_of_a_sailboat>"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "kind": "task"
  }
}
```

#### Client asks for coloring the boat red

Refers to previous taskID and uses same contextId.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-002",
  "method": "message/send",
  "params": {
    "message": {
      "role": "user",
      "messageId": "msg-user-002",
      "contextId": "ctx-conversation-abc", // Same contextId
      "referenceTaskIds": ["task-boat-gen-123"] // Optional: Referencing the previous task
      "parts": [
        {
          "kind": "text",
          "text": "That's great! Can you make the sailboat red?"
          // Optional: In case the agent asked for actual relevant artifact.
          // Client could provide the artifact data in parts.
          // Also it could add metadata to the part to
          // reference the specific artifact.
          // "metadata": {
          //   "referenceArtifacts: [
          //      {
          //        "artifactId": "artifact-boat-v1-xyz",
          //        "taskId": "task-boat-gen-123"
          //      }
          //   ]
          // }
        }
      ],
    }
  }
}
```

#### Agent responds with new image artifact

- Creates new task in same contextId.
- Boat image artifact has same name. but a new artifactId.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-002",
  "result": {
    "id": "task-boat-color-456", // New task ID
    "contextId": "ctx-conversation-abc", // Same contextId
    "status": {
      "state": "completed",
    },
    "artifacts": [
      {
        "artifactId": "artifact-boat-v2-red-pqr", // New artifactId
        "name": "sailboat_image.png", // Same name as the original artifact
        "description": "A generated image of a red sailboat on the ocean.",
        "parts": [
          {
            "kind": "file",
            "file": {
              "name": "sailboat_image.png",
              "mimeType": "image/png",
              "bytes": "<base64_encoded_png_data_of_a_RED_sailboat>"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "kind": "task"
  }
}
```

#### Requiring User Consent for a Sensitive Operation

The client requests the agent to book a flight, which requires user consent due to the sensitive nature of the operation.

##### Client sends message to agent for flight booking

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-003",
  "method": "message/send",
  "params": {
    "message": {
      "role": "user",
      "parts": [
        {
          "kind": "text",
          "text": "Book a flight to Helsinki for next week."
        }
      ],
      "messageId": "msg-user-003",
      "contextId": "ctx-travel-xyz"
    }
  }
}
```

##### Agent responds with a task requiring consent

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-003",
  "result": {
    "id": "task-flight-booking-789",
    "contextId": "ctx-travel-xyz",
    "status": {
      "state": "user-consent-required",
      "message": "Please confirm consent to proceed with booking the flight."
    },
    "artifacts": [],
    "kind": "task"
  }
}
```

##### Client provides consent

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-004",
  "method": "message/send",
  "params": {
    "message": {
      "role": "user",
      "messageId": "msg-user-004",
      "contextId": "ctx-travel-xyz",
      "referenceTaskIds": ["task-flight-booking-789"],
      "parts": [
        {
          "kind": "text",
          "text": "I consent to booking the flight."
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

##### Agent completes the task

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-004",
  "result": {
    "id": "task-flight-booking-789",
    "contextId": "ctx-travel-xyz",

        "description": "Flight booking confirmation for Helsinki.",
        "parts": [
          {
            "kind": "file",
            "file": {
              "name": "flight_confirmation.pdf",
              "mimeType": "application/pdf",
              "bytes": "<base64_encoded_pdf_data>"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "kind": "task"
